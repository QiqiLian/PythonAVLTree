# AVL Tree Project
This project implements an AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) tree in Python. AVL trees are a self-balancing binary search tree that ensures efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations while maintaining the balance of the tree.

## Overview

This project consists of three main files:
- `node.py`: Defines the `Node` class, which represents a node in the AVL tree.
- `avltree.py`: Implements the `AVLTree` class, which provides methods for AVL tree operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and balancing.
- `main.py`: Contains the interactive menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the AVL tree.

## Usage

To use this project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run `main.py` to interact with the AVL tree. Follow the on-screen instructions to insert, delete, search, and print the AVL tree.

## Files

- `node.py`: Contains the definition of the `Node` class, representing a node in the AVL tree.
- `avltree.py`: Implements the `AVLTree` class, which handles AVL tree operations.
- `main.py`: Provides the user interface for interacting with the AVL tree.
